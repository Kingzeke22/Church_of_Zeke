					Welcome to my Corner of the Web!
				</h1>
				<p>
					Here I'll add links to good accuracte sources with a notation where you can reference them with just a number. 
					That way when having online fights you can reference a source by saying (zeke.church/1, replace 1 with whatever number corresponds to the source you would like to reference. 
					This is also the place where I will write more in depth on issues and share my thoughts while linking to the sources I used to substantiate my positions and claims.  
					Opinions without evidence is just gossip and I will try to limit that as much as possible.  
					If you have questions on my thoughts or need clarification just leave a comment or shoot me a message and I'll try to clarify if I think your question has merit.
					Also if anyone would like to debate a topic I'm happy to do that and will leave the guidelines of debates below.
				</p>
